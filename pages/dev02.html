      <h2 id="links">Links</h2>
      <p>Links are important on web pages for the sake of mobility and for the spread of the wealth of information available via the internet. The internet's primary means of navigating from page to page is by links. a link is an address that corresponds to a specific page on the internet and by clicking on a link you are directed to that location and you will then also be able to use and view the information to be found there. The way that we set up a link is by first creating an element on the page, and then giving a value to the element so that  it will contain the page location. <br><br> <strong>Example: &lt;a href=&quot;www.google.com&quot;&gt;</strong></p>

      <h2 id="imgs">Images</h2>
      <p>Images are another important addition to a web page. Images are useful when something is easier to understand when it can be visualized, or when you find a really fun joke to share. Images are simply a stable on web pages now. Even most page logos are image files. Another common use of images is for illustrating a guide or tutorial. If you have anything graphical to add to a web page then you will be using an image as well. More information on images and there appearance on a web page can be found <a href="./dev02pages/image-guide.html">here</a>.</p>

    <div>
      <h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
      <p>Tables are incredibly useful, past present and future. In the present and forever on tables will be used to Organize ideas into very easily identifiable categories, based on rows and columns. In the past, tables were used to format web pages to allow for side bars, footers, and headers, as well as compartmental information on pages. We don&apost use this method anymore of course, we have style sheets (CSS) for that now. In the future, tables will probably never really go away since they are incredibly reliable for putting information into a useful format. An example of a table on a web page is available <a href="./dev02pages/image-guide.html">here</a>.</p>
