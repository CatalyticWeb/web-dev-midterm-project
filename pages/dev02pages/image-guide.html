    <h1>Image File Type Overview</h1>
    <p>The following are some examples of differing file types in browsers, and their uses in web development.
  </header>
  
  <section>
    <h2>JPEG</h2>
    <p>JPEG files are best used when the image is a photograph or something that has a dynamic color variation, i.e. There are tons of shades of the colors present. This is also a format that does not handle compression very well.</p><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Small</th>
        <th>Medium</th>
        <th>Large</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../../img/NewYorkSky_Small_200x97.jpg" alt="New York Sky Small" width="200" height="97"></td>
        <td><img src="../../img/NewYorkSky_Medium_500x242.jpg" alt="New York Sky Medium" width="500" height="242"></td>
        <td><img src="../../img/NewYorkSky_Large_750x363.jpg" alt="New York Sky Large" width="750" height="363"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>PNG</h2>
    <p>PNG is a great format for compression as it is a lossless format. This simply means that it preserves the image data through compression, and that in turn prevents artificats from appearing in the image file. The downside is that these files are much larger due to the lossless format. Good for Logos and text.</p><br>
     <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Small</th>
        <th>Medium</th>
        <th>Large</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../../img/Tesla_Small_200x54.PNG" alt="Tesla Logo Small" width="200" height="54"></td>
        <td><img src="../../img/Tesla_Medium_500x135.PNG" alt="Tesla Logo Medium" width="500" height="135"></td>
        <td><img src="../../img/Tesla_Large_750x202.PNG" alt="Tesla Logo Large" width="750" height="202"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>GIF</h2>
    <p>GIFs are primarily used for image files that have animation in them. They do not compress as well as PNG, but they are smaller than PNG and support Transparency, which JPEG does not.</p><br>
     <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Small</th>
        <th>Medium</th>
        <th>Large</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../../img/TeslaSmall_200x54.gif" alt="Tesla Logo Small" width="200" height="54"></td>
        <td><img src="../../img/TeslaMedium_500x135.gif" alt="Tesla Logo Medium" width="500" height="135"></td>
        <td><img src="../../img/TeslaLarge_750x202.gif" alt="Tesla Logo Large" width="750" height="202"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br><br>
    <p>Those are just a few examples and suggestions for jpeg, png and gif image file formats. Information about Images and Tables can be found back on our <a href="../dev02.html">home page</a>.</p>
